# CovidPort
CovidPort is a solution developed  for the help and support theme during hackcovid 2.0 hackathon.

# Problem Statement
Since April, India has been witnessing a surge in Covid-19 infections with the country seeing over 3 lakh fresh cases of Covid-19 daily. Amid this massive surge, healthcare personnel in India have been trying to do their best under trying circumstances. To prevent the infection socially, the lockdown was imposed globally, which not only resulted in the halt of all economic and social activity in society but led to the dissemination of  false information and lack of awareness among a lot of people.

People within India are getting panicked, emotionally unsecured, depressed and in a stage of confusion, unaware about facilities provided by the government, regarding reliable news sources, symptoms of COVID‐19 and its prevention. People are taking coronavirus infection as a social stigma, so as a consequence people are hiding their illness and showing their unwillingness to approach hospitals. This hesitancy to get tested, reliance on  self-made medication are  just major obstacles in preventing further spread of Covid-19.

# Solution
Our main motto while developing this solution was to <b>connect individuals through our system to be more self-aware, educated and supportive of one and another</b>.

Therefore, This how we approached this, we developed  <b>CovidPort</b>, a web portal that <b>educates people from different walks of life</b> on different variants of COVID-19 and its symptoms, common recovery guidelines for mildly-symptomatic patients, and ways to stop the spread and break the chain. We integrated this with <b>a visualizer that brings in live data</b> of the current COVID- 19 stats,  <b>a forum with 3 main categories for users to carry on healthy discussions, support recovering patients and even ask for leads</b>. At last, <b>a donate page which contains NGOs and fundraiser’s supporting COVID-19 relief</b>.

In order to make CovidPort more accessible for users all around India, we also integrated it with google translate , making our website accessible in <b>108 different languages</b>! 

# Impact
 
This  will help common people to understand the threaten levels of the virus in society. He/she will be able to adopt the necessary precautionary measures to avoid infection from illness by getting proper and reliable information from time to time. 

The users shall now be able to also discuss with each other and  rule out fake news and buzz , discuss recovery routines and also if in need for leads can ask for help, where potential connects can help them out.

The solution we have developed is totally user oriented hence one of the best methods of impact metrics which can be used to analyse its effect. We plan to conduct surveys regularly to see if  the objective is met by taking into consideration the common people’s expectations and preferences.
